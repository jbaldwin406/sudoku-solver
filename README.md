# sudoku-solver
Sudoku solver using python/pygame

# solver.py
Solver.py uses a backtracking algorithm to solve a given sudoku puzzle. It will print out the result in terminal with a few embellishments to make it easier to read

# solver_visual.py
Solver_visual.py uses the same principals as solver.py but I incorporated pygame to visualize the backtracking algorithm in action. 

Future Improvements: add ability to choose sudoku puzzle from outside sources instead of manually entering it
                     improve display by upgrading to React frontend and improve UI so user can more effectively interact.
